### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**Not-yourCoder/Not-yourCoder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job. :)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MERN stack...react to be exact.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about javascript.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: mail: b.aarjya@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: (who put this here, utter bullshit) he /him
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are only two genders. Change my mind.
